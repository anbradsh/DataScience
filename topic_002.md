# Breakout One
This will be the most open ended of our work this semester and it will give me a chance to get to know you and to know each other.

Itâ€™s fairly standard to thinking of the following specialists positions in data science.
- Programer
- Statistician
- Domain expert/Business lead
- Machine Learning 

Quick poll to see how each of you self identify with each position currently?
What position do you want to have when you are done with you schooling? 

The project divided into roughly equal teams.
** Write job descriptions for each position for starting a data science team for self driving cars.**
