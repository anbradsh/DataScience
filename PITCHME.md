## Data Science


Topic_001:
---

  - My Path: English BA -> Computer Sci. PhD (i.e. long road)
  - My Background:  Jump starting teams and groups (Ecolabs, Argonne, Triggr Health, SAP, Data Science for Social Good.)
  - I am Coach/enabler >> disciplinarian
  - You need to be: patient, diligent, self starting

  Why this perspective is important:
- Data Science == Programing, Statistics, Math, Domain/Business Specialist, 
- Programing == Data engineer, code optimization, Object Oriented design, Scientific Programing
- Statistics == Bayesian, Frequentist, Statistical Machine Learning
- Math == Numerical Linear Algebra, Wavelets, Signal processing, 


With so many ways to contribute, it’s hard to figure out how to be you versus how to be someone else.

Class Notes:
1. There are no labs(i.e. they are not manditory).
2. Simply logging into the platform for live sessions will earn 1/2 of your participation grade.  The rest will come from actual participation in the class.
3. Homework for 1 is due before the start of Live Session 2. 
4. All late homework gets a 1/6th point deduction.  
5. Its not too early to start thinking about topic for final project.(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
6. This class starts slow then builds in speed.  
7. You are  encouraged to collaborate on homeowork, but please make note of it on your submission.  
8. If you learn a bunch and develop your skills you will definitely get a good grade regardless of what path it takes to get there.

Crucial resources:

If you are just getting started with R.  Install r studio and install the swirl package.  
http://swirlstats.com/students.html

We will use:  install_from_swirl("R Programming")

We will complete the first 15 assignments over the first 4 weeks.

Breakout One

This will be the most open ended of our work this semester and it will give me a chance to get to know you and to know each other.It’s fairly standard to thinking of the following specialists positions in data science.

- Programer
- Statistician
- Domain expert/Business lead
- Machine Learning

Quick poll to see how each of you self identify with each position currently? What position do you want to have when you are done with you schooling?
** Write job descriptions for each position for starting a data science team for self driving cars.**
