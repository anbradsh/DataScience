## Data Science


Topic_001:
---

  - My Path: English BA -> Computer Sci. PhD (i.e. long road)
  - My Background:  Jump starting teams and groups (Ecolabs, Argonne, Triggr Health, SAP, Data Science for Social Good.)
  - I am Coach/enabler >> disciplinarian
  - You need to be: patient, diligent, self starting

  Why this perspective is important:
- Data Science == Programing, Statistics, Math, Domain/Business Specialist, 
- Programing == Data engineer, code optimization, Object Oriented design, Scientific Programing
- Statistics == Bayesian, Frequentist, Statistical Machine Learning
- Math == Numerical Linear Algebra, Wavelets, Signal processing, 


With so many ways to contribute, it’s hard to figure out how to be you versus how to be someone else.

Class Notes:
1. There are no labs(i.e. they are not manditory).
2. Simply logging into the platform for live sessions will earn 1/2 of your participation grade.  The rest will come from actual participation in the class.
3. Homework for 1 is due before the start of Live Session 2. 
4. All late homework gets a 1/6th point deduction.  
5. Its not too early to start thinking about topic for final project.(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
6. This class starts slow then builds in speed.  
7. You are  encouraged to collaborate on homeowork, but please make note of it on your submission.  
8. If you learn a bunch and develop your skills you will definitely get a good grade regardless of what path it takes to get there.

Crucial resources:

If you are just getting started with R.  Install r studio and install the swirl package.  
http://swirlstats.com/students.html

We will use:  install_from_swirl("R Programming")

We will complete the first 15 assignments over the first 4 weeks.

Breakout One

This will be the most open ended of our work this semester and it will give me a chance to get to know you and to know each other.It’s fairly standard to thinking of the following specialists positions in data science.

- Programer
- Statistician
- Domain expert/Business lead
- Machine Learning

Quick poll to see how each of you self identify with each position currently? What position do you want to have when you are done with you schooling?
** Write job descriptions for each position for starting a data science team for self driving cars.**

- Programing == Data engineer, code optimizer, Object Oriented coder, Scientific Programing
- Statistics == Bayesian, Frequentist, Statistical Machine Learning
- Math == Numerical Linear Algebra, Wavelets, Signal processing

# Overview of class

My goal is to give you a one degree of distance to the stuff thats happening in the book.

There is a lot of technical syntax to consider in this class, my hope is our discussions will be more about the big overview nad how to integrate DS into work.

How to learn:
- some algorithms are designed best run on silicon and others on carbon. 
- You need to develop ways of thinking about the problem that allows you to apply your techniques.
- What question would you like to be able to answer with these skills that you can't currently?  
- Stack overflow life cycle (1. Can't find question, 2. Finding answers, 3. Realizing many answers are poor.)
---
What is machine learning:
- There is no simple solution to statistical validity.  There is no function, but rather a conversation.
- Currently four ways of thinking about data. Tall, flat, square, blocks
---

Language choice:
- coding is not about syntax
Syntax is how you communicate correclty, but programing is about ideas.  
- python > pandas
- scripting versus programing, interactive environment versus output
- Python packages versus R repo

Tendency to treat ML practitioners as "Keepers of the algorithms", with many magic tricks up thier sleave. Like magic tricks when people figutre out how an algorithm made its decision, they often feel like the impossilble was just a cheap trick.
