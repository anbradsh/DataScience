### Git!

&nbsp;

**Two Big approaches:**

- Git from the CMD line:  Powerful, flexible, irritating
- Git from Rstudio:  Simple, easy, limiting

**Two Secondary approaches:**
- Working on MASTER branch all the time
- Working with Branches

*Today we are ignoring branches to keep the workflow simple.*

&nbsp;

### Workflow

First day of work:
1. **git clone** *repo-loc*

Make New file:

2. **git add** *file-name*

Before Work:

3. **git pull**

After Work:

4. **git commit -m** " *a-message* "
5. **git push**

Confused:

6. **git status**

Other:

7. **git del**
8. **git checkout**
9. **git commit -am** " *a-message* "
10. **git commit -am 'a'; git push**

# Breakout Session

Everyone should have set up thier github repo while doing the async coursework. In each group pick someone to be Student A, and that person will clone Student B's repo.  Student B will give collaborator access to Student A using Github and Student A should add a single file and push it back up to Student B.
