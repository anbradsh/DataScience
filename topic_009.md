      Powerful, flexible, irritating

- Git from Rstudio
      Simple, easy, limiting

Two Secondary approaches:
- Working on MASTER branch all the time
- Working with Branches

only 1st time: git clone REPOLOCATION
only when making NEW files:  git add AFILENAME

Before Working: git pull
WORK
After Working:
1. git commit -m "AMESSAGE"
2. git push

When Confused:
   git status
