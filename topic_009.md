Git!

Two Big approaches:

- Git from the CMD line.
      Powerful, flexible, irritating

- Git from Rstudio
      Simple, easy, limiting

Two Secondary approaches:
- Working on MASTER branch all the time
- Working with Branches

Today we are ignoring branches to keep the workflow simple.

First day of work:
 1.git clone REPOLOCATION

Make New file:
 2. git add AFILENAME

Before Working: git pull
WORK
After Working:
3. git commit -m "AMESSAGE"
5. git push

Confused:
6. git status
