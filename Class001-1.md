# Intro:

### Who Am I?
See photo above?
#### Education
  - English BA -> Computer Science PhD (i.e. long road)
#### Work
  - Jump starting teams and groups(Ecolabs, Argonne, Triggr Health)
### What role I will take
  - Coach/enabler >> disciplinarian

### What role you will need to take

# Why this perspective is important:
- Data Science == Programing, Statistics, Math,  Domain Specialist, Business specialist
- Programing == Data engineer, code optimizer, Object Oriented coder, Scientific Programing
- Statistics == Bayesian, Frequentist, Statistical Machine Learning
- Math == Numerical Linear Algebra, Wavelets, Signal processing, 

With so many ways to contribute, itâ€™s hard to figure out how to be you versus how to be someone else.  



#Disclaimer:  I have dysgraphia. It's a kind of visual blindness for symbols.  What this means: Get on github and fix my typos.  Starting in markdown and moving to Latex at somepoint.
