# Intro:

#### Education
  - English BA -> Computer Science PhD (i.e. long road)
#### Work
  - Jump starting teams and groups(Ecolabs, Argonne, Triggr Health, Data Science for Social Good.)
### What role I will take
  - Coach/enabler >> disciplinarian

### What role you will need to take
  - patient, diligent, self starting
  - learn a new communication style
  - learn a new way of signaling you involvment in a community
  


### Different roles 
- Async and Book are most important for homworks and quizs
- Live sesions are most valuable for final presentation 
- Directly after live session is best time for going over homework/remidial help
- Office hours provide over flow for that time
- Slack provides opportunity for collaboration between students


# Why this perspective is important:
- Data Science == Programing, Statistics, Math,  Domain Specialist, Business specialist
- Programing == Data engineer, code optimizer, Object Oriented coder, Scientific Programing
- Statistics == Bayesian, Frequentist, Statistical Machine Learning
- Math == Numerical Linear Algebra, Wavelets, Signal processing, 


With so many ways to contribute, itâ€™s hard to figure out how to be you versus how to be someone else.  




Class Notes:
1. There are no labs(i.e. they are not manditory).
2. Simply logging into the platform for live sessions will earn 1/2 of your participation grade.  The rest will come from actuall participation in the class.
3. Homework for 1 is due before the start of Live Session 2. 
4. Its not too early to start thinking about topic for final project.(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
5. This class starts slow then builds in speed.  
6. You are strongly encouraged to collaborate on homeowork, but please make note of it on your submission.

Crucial resources:

If you are just getting started with R.  Install r studio and install the swirl package.  

http://swirlstats.com/students.html
We will use:  install_from_swirl("R Programming")
We will complete the first 15 assignments over the first 4 weeks.  


If you are a SE(sofware engineer) and the above was too simple,  the link below explians how R works under the hood.

#### Disclaimer:  I have dysgraphia. It's a kind of visual blindness for symbols.  What this means: Get on github and fix my typos.  Starting in markdown and moving to Latex at somepoint.



Notes:
If you learn a bunch and develop your skills you will definitely get a good grade regardless of what path it takes to get there.
